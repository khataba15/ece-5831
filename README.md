# ece-5831
final project on Upper exo sleleton that is trained using a stochastic gradient approach.
Team member: Mujtaba Khan Mohammed
The exoskeleton has sophisticated computing algorithms with simple feedback mechanisms that is stochastic gradient approach. The Algorithm used here will be a deep learning model where the electrical spikes whether it be from EMG ( Electromyography) or EEG (Electroencephalography) are used to train the weights from the sample recorded data of healthy subjects and the actuation part should be the output command of the network. It has multiple electrodes working in fusion to further improve stability and performance. This model is mainly concerned on the EMG data learning which should be able to recognize the hand movements after the training.

(In the end, I was getting wrong value for the last test data is because I forgot to change the test label index, the model has a 99%accuracy and works perfectly.)
